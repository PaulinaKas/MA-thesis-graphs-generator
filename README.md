## **General info**:
The main goal of this app is **reducing time** spent on generating over 20 charts which I needed to include in **my master's thesis**. 
Because I wanted all charts to be in the same style I decided to write a program that did it for me.

The program is ready to work with:
* files which are .csv 
* user who wants to display on chart **more than one line** and more than one y-axis
* .csv files which have **different lenghts** (number of rows) and number of columns

Only things which user needs to do are uploading of necessary .csv files and changing names of title, axes and labels in main script.
     
## **Technologies**:
Python 3.7.4

### Libraries and packages which have been used:
 - **numpy**
 - **pandas**
 - **matplotlib**
 
 
 ## **Setup**:
 macOS 10.14.6
 


## **Status**:

The next steps will be:
* preparing script to be able work on .csv files with different date formats
